        I chose to do a one button game. Out of every option you presented and everything I looked into this seems 
        like the most fun option. I’ve been a gamer my entire life, hell I am even on the UMW Esports Valorant team (Necc champs :P). 
        I wanted to create a game that while simple, can be some mindless fun. With me being new to coding I wanted to be able to make 
        something that wasn’t overly ambitious but still challenged me on my level. This led me to thinking about all the games I’d play 
        on school computers in elementary school. This project was inspired by early flash games like Raft Wars and the simple game of darts. 
        Raft wars is a little too complicated for my skill set, but its limited control scheme and gameplay loop that revolves around timing 
        and planning trajectories of projectiles were my main inspiration. These concepts would be implemented well into a darts game.
        My goal in this project was to take everything I’ve learned in the past few weeks into a single project. I looked through my previous code and
        used a lot of the ideas to create this game. I even got out of my comfort zone and experimented and got a lot more technical ideas. I am proud 
        that I went from never touching a real programming language to now, where I have created my own game hosted on my own website.
        The biggest problem was determining how to make each object detect collision and then react to that collision accordingly. Originally the 
        target would stop when the dart was in motion, then reset if the dart got reset. I had to develop a way for the target's path to continue 
        even if the dart got reset. I then had to get the collision working, as often when working on this project the dart would just pass right through 
        the target or hit to target no matter how far away it was. I went through a number of iterations and ideas to get it to where it is now. I even created 
        a custom background in ms paint. I think that overall, I achieved what I set out to do. I created a functional, if not a little buggy, dart game that keeps
        track of score and has collision detection that works. I have iterated on ideas from previous assignments as well as experimented with some new ideas. I think
        that if I got another chance to make a new game it would go a lot smoother than this one. That has been a recurring theme for my work in this class. 
        It is always really frustrating the first time, but once I get it working it makes a lot more sense in the end.
