    <title>Emoji</title> 
    <!--
        Use this page to complete the "Emoji" exercise:
        https://canvas.umw.edu/courses/1446087/assignments/10969844
   
   https://emojipedia.org/expressionless-face/
   I based my exercise on this face, specifically the samsung version as that is the device type I use.
   I do not like emojis so I chose one that could best replicate my feelings towards them. I have little
   to no coding experience before this so I also chose one which I thought I could most effectively create.
