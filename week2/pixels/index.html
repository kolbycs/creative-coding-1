        I chose to pixelize a photograph of my oldest dog, Chief. I chose to make the pixels into
        triangles, which took some tweaking of values to get working. I made them big enought that
        the image is a little hard to understand without seeing the orignial. I like the idea
        of triangles because pixels are normally square so i thought it would be interesting.
        Their orientation is facing down and it works quite well as the motion works in tandem with 
        the image. I wanted it to represent how stuck to the couch he is, as in the picture he is sleeping.
        It also reminds me of old mosaics so thats pretty cool :P.
