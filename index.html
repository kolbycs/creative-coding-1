        This project took inspiration from my bedroom, and is an amalgamation of what<br>
        that represents into a webpage. It's pretty much the first thing I had to code<br>
        all by myself, and I've improved the code a lot in this version.

        This project is actually a picture of my eldest dog Chief. My original code was<br>
        just circles for pixels, so I decided to spice it up by adding some more shapes.<br>
        I think it turned out well, as the diamond pattern that is formed is pretty cool.

        This project is an abstract clock that uses the first three planets and the sun<br>
        to keep track of time. I like that at first glance you can't even tell that it is<br>
        a clock. I've updated the code so that it's formatted a lot nicer.

        <a href="https://kolbycs.github.io/creative-coding-true/week4/book/index.html">Palindrome</a><br>
        This project may seem simple, but there is a lot of symbolism. The words themselves are<br>
        a palindrome, and it's formatted so the pages stack on top of each other. It plays into<br>
        the idea that life is, in fact, never odd or even, it's often grey.
