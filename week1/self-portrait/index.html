    <title>My Self Portrait</title>

        I chose to decorate my portrait much like my room. I found a blue background with a design
        that I think best represent myself. I paired this with the right-side image, which is art
        for some music which I enjoy, that I believe is a good example of my interests. The image 
        on the left is a data selfie, which is based off of Giorgia Lupi's ideas. I finished it off 
        with an excerpt from a song which I like. I made this kind of abstract so I hope it meets
        the criteria!

I felt soft waves of purpose crashing onto the surface --<br>
I was feeling nostalgic for the days when --<br>
My thoughts dripped on to my head from the ceiling --<br>
I remember the feeling --<br>
And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time</p>
