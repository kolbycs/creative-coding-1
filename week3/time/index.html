       I spent a long time brainstorming different ideas for this project but
       most of them I determined to be too ambitious. I settled on a sort of diagram
       of the planets which all move at the rate of different measurements of time.
       I think it is a creative representation of time because at first you just think
       it is just a graphic but there is actually some hidden meaning. Overall, I
       found it difficult to take my limited coding knowledge and apply it in a
       way which could be considered creative.
